                            Our goal is to raise $500,000. However, investors may purchase as many units 
                            as they desire (up to 20 total units) at the price of $25,000 per unit. 
                            Each unit represents 2.5% company profits, reaching a maximum of 50% company 
                            profits if utilizing all 20 units. Our minimum raise is $100,000, 
                            meaning we will not spend money on development until at least 4 units ($100,000) is raised.

                            see a return for their investment. Once the movie goes into production, 
                            development investors will also see an automatic return of the full amount 
                            they put in, plus 20%, which will be paid to them using the production 
                            budget. So basically, as long as the movie is made development investors 
                            will see a return on their investment, and everything from box office 
                            returns, to DVD income, given to the company, is simply extra profit.
